In the previous programming assignment you have implemented a plane sweep algorithm for line segment intersection.

Use your implementation to evaluate it compared to a brute-force approach.

For this you need to generate suitable input.

You can use the following:

Given a parameter r>0, line segments are generated independently by:

1. drawing one endpoint at random positions (x,y) within the square [0,1]^2 with a uniform distribution
2. drawing the other endpoint at random positions within the square [(x-r, y-r) (x+r, y+r)] with a uniform distribution.

Do experiments for r = n^-z with z = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.

Answer the following questions:

1. Starting at which n does your algorithm outperform the brute-force one for the various r?
2. Does the running time of your algorithm match what you expect from the theory?
